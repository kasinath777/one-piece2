    <p id="p1">The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races, such as dwarves (more akin to faeries),
        giants,
        merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known
        as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting
        of dozens of member states. The central tension of the series pits the world government against pirates. The
        series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes dastardly villains, but also
        any individuals that do not submit to the world government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The
        One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like "Devil Fruits", which are mysterious fruits that grant
        whoever eats them one of three types of transformative powers. Examples include a body made of rubber, the
        ability to transform into powerful animals or humanoid-animal hybrid forms, or being able to generate, control,
        or become a certain element. Another supernatural power is "Haki", which grants its users enhanced willpower,
        observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on
        certain Devil Fruit users.</p>
